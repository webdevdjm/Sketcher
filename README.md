# Sketchpad Delight!

An etch-a-sketch style drawing application.

## Details

So along with learning HTML and CSS, along with a focus on Javascript and jQuery for this project, my goal in making this was to simulate drawing with a pencil and sketching. The longer you hold down the darker it will get, so shading is possible. There is also an eraser which works in reverse and will slowly remove pixels.
I would love to implement a save to jpg or other image type. Also needs to be made responsive and mobile friendly.
